### **Project Title: Military Soldier Safety and Weapon Detection Using YOLO and Computer Vision**

#### **Project Description:**

This project aims to enhance military and defense systems by leveraging **Computer Vision** and **deep learning** for real-time **weapon detection** and **soldier safety monitoring**. By using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection algorithm integrated with **OpenCV**, the system can accurately detect weapons such as guns and knives from live video feeds. Additionally, it can identify protective gear (like helmets or bulletproof vests), ensuring soldiers are properly equipped.

The interface is built using **Streamlit**, enabling an intuitive and real-time visualization of detections, alerts, and insights. The solution is designed to operate in high-risk environments, assisting security forces in monitoring sensitive areas and automating threat detection to improve response time and situational awareness.
